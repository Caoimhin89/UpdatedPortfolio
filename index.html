                A highly-motivated, self-driven web developer with an affinity for learning new languages
                and mastering logical systems. Recently transitioned from a background in Russian studies,
                and willing to go to great lengths to master new skills. First became interested in
                programming while teaching English to the employees of Russiaâ€™s largest tech companies
                in Moscow and delved right into full-stack web development shortly thereafter, focusing
                primarily on the MEAN and MERN stacks.

                          two major tasks. First, it interfaces with a third-party vendor to reserve serial numbers for unique mail pieces. Secondly, it interfaces with
                          the US Postal Service's Intelligent Mail Barcode API and uses the serial numbers and other data inputs to generate barcodes. These enable us to
                          track outgoing and incoming mail pieces and alert our customer communications department whenever client responses have been mailed, saving the
                          company millions of dollars in redundant mailings each year.

                          Successfully completed a 14-week intensive Java Web Application Development Bootcamp in Cleveland, Ohio. Throughout the program,
                          I learned important design patterns, object-oriented programming principles, best practices in development, the fundamentals of
                          Agile project management, and much more. Each new subject unit ended with a project that incorporated all of the concepts introduced
                          during the unit, and the entire program concluded with a major capstone project embodying everything we'd learned in a real,
                          fully-functional web application built from the ground up.

                          day. In addition to in-classroom learning, I rented an apartment in the city and spent my free time meeting and speaking with
                          friends, and going about normal daily activities entirely in Russian. This situation made for a very rapid and thorough absorbtion
                          of the language in a relatively short period of time.

                          at a handful of universities where Russian language instruction is offered, on which I received the highest score (Superior on the ACTFL scale).
                          In addition to language-related studies, I also completed coursework in Russian, Soviet, and Eastern European history, politics, economics,

              Learning new skills is not easy. To accelerate my progress and internalize concepts that I read about, I like to dive in
              and get coding. Making use of design patterns, best practices, and other coding techniques by using them right away in real
              projects is the most effective way I have found to learn them. For that reason, I have a number of independent projects
              that I have built, and others that are presently in development. Not all of my projects are public, but below you can learn a
              little bit about the ones that are.

                      An interactive map of the city of Ufa, where I studied for one year (2012-13). The application was created with the Knockout.js
                      MVVM framework and Google Maps. The city's points of interest are retrieved dynamically from the Foursquare API and compiled into
                      a list which may be filtered by the user based on a number of criteria or by a text query. Filtering the list automatically updates
                      the markers on the map in accordance with the user's preferences. Clicking on a point of interest, either from the list or on the
                      corresponding map marker, opens an info-window with content downloaded from Foursquare.
